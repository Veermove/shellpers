# shellpers

Shell helpers.

<br />




## what?

A few scripts, configuration files and desktop shortcuts.
I use them. You can use them too, if you want.

<br />




## how?

Clone the repo and link contents of the `src/.local/bin` folder
with your `~/.local/bin` directory. Other useful stuff is also here
(such as nvidia eGPU configuration).
